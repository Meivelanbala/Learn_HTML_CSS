        <h1>Ms The Best Captain :</h1>
        <p>His win percentage of <b>55.00 per cent makes him one of the best ODI captains ever</b>. ODIs were Dhoni's strongest format, both as a captain and player. In 200 matches he led India, Dhoni scored 6,641 runs at an average of 53.55 in 172 innings. He scored six centuries and 47 innings, with the best score of 139.Under his captaincy, India would go on to capture the<b> ICC Cricket World Cup after 28 years in 2011,</b> with Dhoni starring in the final against Sri Lanka with 91* and hitting the winning six. Men in Blue also captured the prestigious ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Also, it was under his captaincy that India won its first-ever Asia Cup in 15 years back in 2010.The high-profile clash between rivals India and Pakistan in ICC T20 World Cup 2007 marked the start of MS Dhoni's career as a captain. In that match, India managed to tie the game despite posting 141/9 in 20 overs. India won the match later through a bowl-out, which saw players from each side taking an aim at the wickets. 

            MSD's first outing as a captain was successful as a young Men in Blue captured the inaugural ICC T20 WC title, defeating Pakistan in the final by five runs. Dhoni's cool composure, trust in his young, new-look side and his unusual decisions, like to give Joginder Sharma, who had leaked runs, the final over in the title clash, set the tone for what was to come.
